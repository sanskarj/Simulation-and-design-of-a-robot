1.The project deals with simulation and design of a robot whose looks are similar to that of a human body. All the parts like legs, hands, face etc
are designed using Solid edge. the parts are connected , controlled and simulated using Simulink.
2. the motion of robot is tested for different inputs and output is analysed by plotting corresponding output vs time graph.
